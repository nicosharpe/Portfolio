# Portfolio
This is the very first iteration of my online portfolio created as part of my EdX bootcamp.

This challenge forced me to completely create a website using HTML and CSS from scratch andnjnon I learned a lot in the process, including how challenging it can be since no-one is going to be able to remember all the processes there are when writing css, although, doing this challenge has definitely been good practice and there is a lot that I have now become familiar with, specifically Grids (flex and regular) and Media Queries for different screen sizes.

# Usage
When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me. You will also see a logo animation I made in Adobe Illustrator and After Effects which in the future will say my full name.

When one of the links in the navigation bar is clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

When viewing the section about my work, the section contains titled images of my applications.

When presented with my first application, that application's image is larger in size than the others.

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

# To come
In a future iteration, when the images of the applications are clicked you will be taken to that deployed application.
